# 🚀 AI Resume Analyzer (International Level)

> **A Dual-Engine Resume Analysis Platform built with Python, Streamlit, and NLP.** > *Mimics real-world ATS systems while providing "Semantic" feedback that keywords miss.*


## 🧠 The Problem
Traditional Resume Parsers (ATS) are dumb. They only look for exact keywords.
- If a job asks for **"Machine Learning"** and you write **"ML"**, you get a **0% score**.
- If you copy-paste the Job Description in white text, you get **100%**.

## 💡 The Solution: Dual-Engine Logic
This project fixes that by running **Two Analysis Engines** side-by-side:

| Feature | Engine 1: The "Strict" ATS | Engine 2: The "Smart" AI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Technology** | Keyword Matching (Python Set Operations) | Vector Embeddings (TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity) |
| **Logic** | Checks for exact word matches (e.g., "Python", "SQL"). | Checks for *contextual meaning* and relevance. |
| **Goal** | Tells you if you will pass the **Robot**. | Tells you if you are actually **Qualified**. |

## ✨ Key Features (Implemented)
- **📄 PDF Parsing:** Extracts text from PDF resumes while preserving structure.
- **🧹 NLP Cleaning:** Removes special characters and formatting noise.
- **🔍 Smart Section Extraction:** Automatically identifies Skills, Education, and Experience sections.
- **📊 Dual Scoring System:** Displays "Keyword Match" vs. "Semantic Match" scores side-by-side.
- **📉 Resume Quality Check:**
    - Flags bullet points that lack **Quantification** (numbers/metrics).
    - Detects skills listed but **not demonstrated** in the Experience section.
